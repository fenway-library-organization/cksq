cksq
----

Lightweight file checksum monitor.

The list of files to check are read from standard input.

File paths (in a compressed form) and cryptographic hashes of their
contents are stored in a BerkeleyDB file.

Compression is achieved by storing every file path as <dir><name> where
<dir> is a BER(like) value identifying the file's parent directory.  Hash
values are also stored in BER(like) format.

To obtain a plain text listing, use option -l:

    $ cksq -l DB
